Day 1 : Web-scrapping
* some websites do provide APIs to access and grab data. 
* some websites allow third party apps to do that. 
* some websites don't allow any of the above two -> manually scrape data.

* Can be done by many libraries in python like beautiful soup, requests-html, etc.
* requests-html is the more preferred one and hence I explore it here. 
* concepts such as grabbing data by class or id selectors, saving data to csv via pandas, extending the code to fetch data from multiple pages via dynamic change in urls, etc.
